# Project Definition of Done (Binding)

A feature or milestone is complete ONLY when:

- All relevant acceptance criteria are satisfied
- All required tests exist and fail when rules are removed
- No excluded MVP features exist in code
- No unnecessary new files were created (new files are allowed when required to implement binding criteria/tests/config)
- No forbidden assumptions were used
- All mode boundaries are enforced server-side

If any condition is unmet, the work is incomplete.
