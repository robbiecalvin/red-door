# Forbidden Assumptions (Binding)

Codex MUST NOT assume:

- That this platform behaves like existing dating apps
- That swipe, match, or ranking logic is “standard”
- That users want efficiency over consent
- That real-time presence implies availability
- That performance optimization is allowed in MVP
- That frontend behavior is authoritative
- That missing rules may be inferred

If a rule is not explicitly defined, Codex must STOP and ASK.
